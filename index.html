        Moving Generation is a platform designed to manage calls for mobility experiences, which change thousands of young Europeans’ lives every year.

The “Moving Generation” is the generation of young people for whom training abroad is not only a necessity to meet the challenges of the job market in the modern world, but also a key step in becoming future European citizens.
